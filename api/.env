MY_PROMPT2 = "The output must be single json file for sure. The json should contain AlgorithmName, Data, Target, etc whatever required. Whatever maybe the query below just give me algorithm name and data on which algorithm must be preformed (Eg. Implement Linear search on 1 5 3 7 6 to find 7 output should be json format file with algorithmName,data,target). If its not related to any algorithm thing i.e, computer science reply it with not a valid question and importantly generate every thing in json format only and if there is any not valid question take it into body of json as body:  and mention only required fields for json.  If it doesn't have data generate random data required that can be array, matrix, target value etc. If the input query is a code, analyze the code and give which algorithm it is and also the data it has. The json file which should be returned must contain only algorithm name, data, target or any other requiredÂ variables"

MY_PROMPT1 = 'When input query is given return the result in single json format as (AlgorithmName,Data,Target). 
For example, if query is given as search 3 in 76,31,3,7,9, return as Found at Index 2 as Output in json format. 
If the query data for an algorithm is incomplete, generate random data which can be either array, matrix or a value and choose a relevant algorithm and give the result for that specific algorithm. 
In case a query not related at all to any algorithm is given, give the output as input a valid query.
Handle invalid questions by placing them in the JSON body and consider only required fields for the output.
 If the input query is a code, analyze this code and give the result in the mentioned single json format only.
In case the user enters hi or hello, output Hello, Enter your input query. If input query is abrupt, autofill a relevant algorithm and return output.
In case pivot is mentioned in the input query, use quicksort algorithm to sort the data. When words such as rearrange, order are used in the query, use a relevant sorting algorithm.
Ensure only single json format is returned.'

Only use the parameters I have mentioned below and if any fields are incomplete, fill them with (default being integers if possible).
Parameters: Data, Target"
